# Data Aggregation & Visualization For Parkour Game

This project is developed as part of the Development V course within the Multimedia & Creative Technology program. The focus of this project is to implement a system for aggregating and visualizing player data to enhance level design, refine gameplay mechanics, and provide players with meaningful insights into their performance.

Key metrics such as completion times, player movement patterns, and interaction hotspots will be tracked and analyzed to identify opportunities for improving the overall player experience. Additionally, visualized statistics will be presented to players, fostering engagement by allowing them to track their progress and compare performance. This system highlights the integration of data-driven design principles within game development, showcasing innovative solutions to enhance both development workflows and player experience.

## Key Features

- **Data Aggregation System** for tracking player performance, including completion times, movement patterns, and interaction hotspots across levels.
- **Gameplay Analytics** that offer insights into player behavior, aiding in the refinement of level design and gameplay mechanics.
- **Player Stats Visualization** presenting real-time statistics to players, enhancing engagement and allowing them to track their performance.
- **Modular Code Structure** designed for easy expansion and adaptability, supporting future gameplay mechanics and features.
- **Level Design & Interaction** focused on creating paths with multiple options for traversal, allowing data tracking to optimize design choices.
